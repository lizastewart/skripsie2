abstract = {Cross-laminated timber (CLT) is increasingly used in medium-rise timber buildings, for the time being up to eight storeys, among other reasons for cost effectiveness and robustness. This paper presents a simple design model using the effective cross-section method for the structural fire design, i.e. the determination of the mechanical resistance with respect to bending (floors). Performing advanced calculations for a large number of lay-ups of various lamination thicknesses, using the thermal and thermo-mechanical properties of wood, charring depths and the reduction of bending resistance of CLT were determined as functions of time of fire exposure. From these results zero-strength layers were derived to be used in the design model using an effective residual cross-section for the determination of mechanical resistance. The model also takes into account different temperature gradients in the CLT in order to include the effect of slower heating rate when the CLT is protected by insulation and/or gypsum plasterboard. The paper also gives results from fire-tests of CLT in bending using beam strips cut from CLT with adequate side protection in order to achieve one-dimensional heat transfer. Reference tests at ambient temperature were performed to predict the moment resistance of the beams being tested in fire.},

abstract = {In the literature, several techniques are implemented to obtain the approximate solution of heat and advection–diffusion equations. However, each method involves certain drawbacks such as high arithmetic computations, lower accuracy in terms of error, and difficult for computer programming. In the present work, the octic B-spline collocation approach is implemented to incorporate the drawback of the other numerical studies in the literature with with high accuracy in terms of error and MATLAB programming is executed to compute the tedious calculation in an easy way toward the improvement of the approximate solution of heat and advection–diffusion equation. The time derivative is discretized by forward difference technique and the Crank–Nicolson scheme is applied for the remaining terms of the advection–diffusion equation. The stability of the scheme is examined and found that the scheme is unconditionally stable. To test the accuracy and efficiency of the scheme, four test problems are computed. A better approximate solution is obtained as compared to existing methods and a good agreement on analytical solutions by the proposed scheme.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT
The thermo‐physical response of timber structures in fire is complex. For this reason, debate still exists today as to the best approaches for simulating thermal response in fire using tools such as finite element analysis (FEA) modelling. Much of the debate is concerned with the thermal properties of timber, for example, conductivity, specific heat and density, at elevated temperature and how such properties should be implemented or interpreted in numerical calculations. For practitioners intending to use modelling as a fire design tool for timber buildings, guidance exists on the thermal properties of softwood in Annex B of EN 1995‐1‐2. These properties are limited for use under standard fire exposure conditions because of the way in which they were derived from calibration against focussed test data. As a result, they cannot be applied to non‐standard fires, which are more representative of real fires due to a combination of varying heating rates and the decay phase of fire development.
The limitations of the standard fire test (and associated curve) are widely understood. As a result, much recent structures in fire research has focussed on the ‘performance based design' of buildings subject to increasingly realistic fire conditions. Such an approach allows engineers to quantify the level of safety that can be achieved in a building should a fire occur. In addition, the design of buildings to withstand fires proportionate to the risks foreseen and also the geometry present results in better value buildings that are inherently more robust. For the same approaches and associated benefits to be realised for timber buildings, then a number of barriers must be overcome. The most obvious of these is engineers' ability to determine timber structure temperatures as a result of fires other than the standard fire curve. This however presents a number of challenges.
Upon heating, the moisture bound within begins to evaporate, volatiles begin to flow from the heated surface and char forms. The rate of which these behaviours occur and the nature of the char that forms depends on a number of factors, but most notably the rate of heating. Upon cooling, the timber member continues to generate heat energy as the surface oxidises. As a result, any models intended to simulate temperature development must consider the relationship not only between temperature and thermo‐physical characteristics but also between heating rate and the process of heat generation. Many models have been developed for this purpose; however, they are extremely complex and are some way from being ready for implementation as design tools. This paper proposes implementing ‘heat of hydration' routines, intended for the curing of concrete structures, to simulate the heating and cooling process in timber structures. Such routines are available in many commercial FEA software packages. The adoption of the hydration routines allows the heat generation process, as a result of oxidation, to be considered in parallel with solid phase heat transfer using apparent thermal properties.
The approach is shown to be very effective in simulating temperature development in timber members subject to parametric design fires. The models developed are benchmarked against experiments conducted in the 1990s by SP Tr{\"{a}}tek. Predictably, a number of the heat generation parameters adopted are shown to depend on the fire dynamics considered. However, recommended parameters are given that provide an acceptable level of accuracy for most design purposes. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Cross-laminated timber (CLT) is increasingly used in medium-rise timber buildings, for the time being up to eight storeys, among other reasons for cost effectiveness and robustness. This paper presents a simple design model using the effective cross-section method for the structural fire design, i.e. the determination of the mechanical resistance with respect to bending (floors). Performing advanced calculations for a large number of lay-ups of various lamination thicknesses, using the thermal and thermo-mechanical properties of wood, charring depths and the reduction of bending resistance of CLT were determined as functions of time of fire exposure. From these results zero-strength layers were derived to be used in the design model using an effective residual cross-section for the determination of mechanical resistance. The model also takes into account different temperature gradients in the CLT in order to include the effect of slower heating rate when the CLT is protected by insulation and/or gypsum plasterboard. The paper also gives results from fire-tests of CLT in bending using beam strips cut from CLT with adequate side protection in order to achieve one-dimensional heat transfer. Reference tests at ambient temperature were performed to predict the moment resistance of the beams being tested in fire.},

abstract = {A common approach to assess the performance of fire insulation panels is the component additive method (CAM). The parameters of the CAM are based on the temperature-dependent thermal material properties of the panels. These material properties can be derived by calibrating finite element heat transfer models using experimentally measured temperature records. In the past, the calibration of the material properties was done manually by trial and error approaches, which was inefficient and prone to error. In this contribution, the calibration problem is reformulated in a probabilistic setting and solved using the Bayesian model calibration framework. This not only gives a set of best-fit parameters but also confidence bounds on the latter. To make this framework feasible, the procedure is accelerated through the use of advanced surrogate modelling techniques: polynomial chaos expansions combined with principal component analysis. This surrogate modelling technique additionally allows one to conduct a variance-based sensitivity analysis at no additional cost by giving access to the Sobol' indices. The calibration is finally validated by using the calibrated material properties to predict the temperature development in different experimental setups.},

abstract = {Ice-induced impact loads on the propeller blades of vessels operating in polar waters represent a notable hazard to ship propulsion systems. Industry guidelines determine the maximum allowable ice-induced propeller moments, but these loads are not practical to measure directly. Recent studies have implemented deterministic inversion methods to determine these impact-induced moments from torque measurements on the propulsion shaft. This study considers this inversion problem from a stochastic perspective. Bayesian inversion is used, first, as a means of determining the optimal regularisation parameters, and second, as an avenue to explore the contributions to uncertainty in the inverted ice loading values due to the linear inversion model. The method is implemented for two sets of shaft-line measurements recorded on the SA Agulhas II, a polar class PC-5 research and supply vessel, via a lumped-mass model for the forward response signal. Using more sophisticated simulation results as prior information for the model uncertainty, it is shown that inverted ice-induced propeller moments around 20{\%} below the industry guideline maximum loading of 1009.9 kN m correspond to a 1{\%} probability of ice-induced moments exceeding this limit. This finding is significant, given the number of propeller impact events for the SA Agulhas II that approached this limit during recent voyages, and highlights the need for considering design specifications for propulsion systems in ice-faring vessels from a risk perspective.},

In the absence of model error, the correct solution to the data assimilation problem is to find the posterior distribution implied by this Bayesian setting. Methods for dealing with data assimilation should then be judged by their ability to probe this distribution. In this paper we propose a range of techniques for probing the posterior distribution, based around the Langevin equation; and we compare these new techniques with existing methods. When the underlying dynamics is deterministic, the posterior distribution is on the space of initial conditions leading to a sampling problem over this space. When the underlying dynamics is stochastic the posterior distribution is on the space of continuous time paths. By writing down a density, and conditioning on observations, it is possible to define a range of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods which sample from the desired posterior distribution, and thereby solve the data assimilation problem. The basic building-blocks for the MCMC methods that we concentrate on in this paper are Langevin equations which are ergodic and whose invariant measures give the desired distribution; in the case of path space sampling these are stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs).

Internationally its use is growing rapidly, although its fire resistance is a topic of ongoing research. This study investigates the fire resistance of CLT wall panels manufactured locally from South African pine and eucalyptus, the most commonly used timber species for CLT in South Africa, through SANS10177-2 compliant fire tests of two 100 mm (33-33-33) thick CLT wall panel samples with dimensions of 0.9 m × 0.9 m. In addition to insulation and integrity fire resistance ratings, the study characterises the charring rate and delamination behaviour of CLT. The recommended integrity and insulation fire resistance ratings for the 100 mm thick SA pine and eucalyptus CLT samples is 60 minutes and 90 minutes respectively. The average charring rate calculated for the SA pine CLT and eucalyptus CLT panels was 0.95 mm/min and 0.76 mm/min respectively. These values are higher than charring rates for bulk timber, due to significant delamination observed in both tests. Associated structural fire resistance rating was estimated for each CLT panel by rational design, giving structural resistance times of 29 mins and 36 mins for the SA pine and eucalyptus CLT, respectively. These times are notably smaller than the insulation and integrity fire ratings reported above, but are only relevant to load-bearing walls. As a result, the tested CLT panels can only be used in multi-storey timber buildings as non-loading bearing walls.},

Further, the behavior of distributions around contractual fee triggers is consistent with an underlying agency conflict between investors and fund managers. Our evidence suggests that managers with higher fees deliver higher gross performance, and highlights that agency costs are an inevitable consequence of the information frictions endemic to agency relationships.},

@article{Wagner2020,
abstract = {A common approach to assess the performance of fire insulation panels is the component additive method (CAM). The parameters of the CAM are based on the temperature-dependent thermal material properties of the panels. These material properties can be derived by calibrating finite element heat transfer models using experimentally measured temperature records. In the past, the calibration of the material properties was done manually by trial and error approaches, which was inefficient and prone to error. In this contribution, the calibration problem is reformulated in a probabilistic setting and solved using the Bayesian model calibration framework. This not only gives a set of best-fit parameters but also confidence bounds on the latter. To make this framework feasible, the procedure is accelerated through the use of advanced surrogate modelling techniques: polynomial chaos expansions combined with principal component analysis. This surrogate modelling technique additionally allows one to conduct a variance-based sensitivity analysis at no additional cost by giving access to the Sobol' indices. The calibration is finally validated by using the calibrated material properties to predict the temperature development in different experimental setups.},

abstract = {Ice-induced impact loads on the propeller blades of vessels operating in polar waters represent a notable hazard to ship propulsion systems. Industry guidelines determine the maximum allowable ice-induced propeller moments, but these loads are not practical to measure directly. Recent studies have implemented deterministic inversion methods to determine these impact-induced moments from torque measurements on the propulsion shaft. This study considers this inversion problem from a stochastic perspective. Bayesian inversion is used, first, as a means of determining the optimal regularisation parameters, and second, as an avenue to explore the contributions to uncertainty in the inverted ice loading values due to the linear inversion model. The method is implemented for two sets of shaft-line measurements recorded on the SA Agulhas II, a polar class PC-5 research and supply vessel, via a lumped-mass model for the forward response signal. Using more sophisticated simulation results as prior information for the model uncertainty, it is shown that inverted ice-induced propeller moments around 20{\%} below the industry guideline maximum loading of 1009.9 kN m correspond to a 1{\%} probability of ice-induced moments exceeding this limit. This finding is significant, given the number of propeller impact events for the SA Agulhas II that approached this limit during recent voyages, and highlights the need for considering design specifications for propulsion systems in ice-faring vessels from a risk perspective.},

Typically some form of regularization is required to ameliorate ill-posed behaviour. In this article we review the Bayesian approach to regularization, developing a function space viewpoint on the subject. This approach allows for a full characterization of all possible solutions, and their relative probabilities, whilst simultaneously forcing significant modelling issues to be addressed in a clear and precise fashion. Although expensive to implement, this approach is starting to lie within the range of the available computational resources in many application areas. It also allows for the quantification of uncertainty and risk, something which is increasingly demanded by these applications. Furthermore, the approach is conceptually important for the understanding of simpler, computationally expedient approaches to inverse problems. {\textcopyright} 2010 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {Cross-laminated timber (CLT) is increasingly used in medium-rise timber buildings, for the time being up to eight storeys, among other reasons for cost effectiveness and robustness. This paper presents a simple design model using the effective cross-section method for the structural fire design, i.e. the determination of the mechanical resistance with respect to bending (floors). Performing advanced calculations for a large number of lay-ups of various lamination thicknesses, using the thermal and thermo-mechanical properties of wood, charring depths and the reduction of bending resistance of CLT were determined as functions of time of fire exposure. From these results zero-strength layers were derived to be used in the design model using an effective residual cross-section for the determination of mechanical resistance. The model also takes into account different temperature gradients in the CLT in order to include the effect of slower heating rate when the CLT is protected by insulation and/or gypsum plasterboard. The paper also gives results from fire-tests of CLT in bending using beam strips cut from CLT with adequate side protection in order to achieve one-dimensional heat transfer. Reference tests at ambient temperature were performed to predict the moment resistance of the beams being tested in fire.},

abstract = {Ice-induced impact loads on the propeller blades of vessels operating in polar waters represent a notable hazard to ship propulsion systems. Industry guidelines determine the maximum allowable ice-induced propeller moments, but these loads are not practical to measure directly. Recent studies have implemented deterministic inversion methods to determine these impact-induced moments from torque measurements on the propulsion shaft. This study considers this inversion problem from a stochastic perspective. Bayesian inversion is used, first, as a means of determining the optimal regularisation parameters, and second, as an avenue to explore the contributions to uncertainty in the inverted ice loading values due to the linear inversion model. The method is implemented for two sets of shaft-line measurements recorded on the SA Agulhas II, a polar class PC-5 research and supply vessel, via a lumped-mass model for the forward response signal. Using more sophisticated simulation results as prior information for the model uncertainty, it is shown that inverted ice-induced propeller moments around 20{\%} below the industry guideline maximum loading of 1009.9 kN m correspond to a 1{\%} probability of ice-induced moments exceeding this limit. This finding is significant, given the number of propeller impact events for the SA Agulhas II that approached this limit during recent voyages, and highlights the need for considering design specifications for propulsion systems in ice-faring vessels from a risk perspective.},

@book{Stuart2010,
abstract = {The subject of inverse problems in differential equations is of enormous practical importance, and has also generated substantial mathematical and computational innovation. Typically some form of regularization is required to ameliorate ill-posed behaviour. In this article we review the Bayesian approach to regularization, developing a function space viewpoint on the subject. This approach allows for a full characterization of all possible solutions, and their relative probabilities, whilst simultaneously forcing significant modelling issues to be addressed in a clear and precise fashion. Although expensive to implement, this approach is starting to lie within the range of the available computational resources in many application areas. It also allows for the quantification of uncertainty and risk, something which is increasingly demanded by these applications. Furthermore, the approach is conceptually important for the understanding of simpler, computationally expedient approaches to inverse problems. {\textcopyright} 2010 Cambridge University Press.},

@article{Apte2007,
abstract = {The viewpoint taken in this paper is that data assimilation is fundamentally a statistical problem and that this problem should be cast in a Bayesian framework. In the absence of model error, the correct solution to the data assimilation problem is to find the posterior distribution implied by this Bayesian setting. Methods for dealing with data assimilation should then be judged by their ability to probe this distribution. In this paper we propose a range of techniques for probing the posterior distribution, based around the Langevin equation; and we compare these new techniques with existing methods. When the underlying dynamics is deterministic, the posterior distribution is on the space of initial conditions leading to a sampling problem over this space. When the underlying dynamics is stochastic the posterior distribution is on the space of continuous time paths. By writing down a density, and conditioning on observations, it is possible to define a range of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods which sample from the desired posterior distribution, and thereby solve the data assimilation problem. The basic building-blocks for the MCMC methods that we concentrate on in this paper are Langevin equations which are ergodic and whose invariant measures give the desired distribution; in the case of path space sampling these are stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). Two examples are given to show how data assimilation can be formulated in a Bayesian fashion. The first is weather prediction, and the second is Lagrangian data assimilation for oceanic velocity fields. Furthermore the relationship between the Bayesian approach outlined here and the commonly used Kalman filter based techniques, prevalent in practice, is discussed. Two simple pedagogical examples are studied to illustrate the application of Bayesian sampling to data assimilation concretely. Finally a range of open mathematical and computational issues, arising from the Bayesian approach, are outlined. {\textcopyright}2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Wagner2020,
abstract = {A common approach to assess the performance of fire insulation panels is the component additive method (CAM). The parameters of the CAM are based on the temperature-dependent thermal material properties of the panels. These material properties can be derived by calibrating finite element heat transfer models using experimentally measured temperature records. In the past, the calibration of the material properties was done manually by trial and error approaches, which was inefficient and prone to error. In this contribution, the calibration problem is reformulated in a probabilistic setting and solved using the Bayesian model calibration framework. This not only gives a set of best-fit parameters but also confidence bounds on the latter. To make this framework feasible, the procedure is accelerated through the use of advanced surrogate modelling techniques: polynomial chaos expansions combined with principal component analysis. This surrogate modelling technique additionally allows one to conduct a variance-based sensitivity analysis at no additional cost by giving access to the Sobol' indices. The calibration is finally validated by using the calibrated material properties to predict the temperature development in different experimental setups.},
