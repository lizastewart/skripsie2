%    Summarize the important findings of your observations.
The $\kappa$-values obtained from the MAP and MCMC analysis give a more accurate model output than those from the Eurocode.
The increased accuracy that the new $\kappa$-values provide, serves as a proof of concept that MCMC analysis can be used to determine more accurate fire ratings. 



%    For each result, describe the patterns, principles, relationships your results show. Explain how your results relate to expectations and to references cited. Explain any agreements, contradictions, or exceptions. Describe what additional research might resolve contradictions or explain exceptions.

%    Suggest the theoretical implications of your results. Extend your findings to other situations or other species. Give the big picture: do your findings help us understand a broader topic?
The accuracy of the Markov Chain Monte-Carlo analysis can be increased by modelling the standard deviation, of both the temperatures and the $\kappa$ values, as random values and solving for them as well. 
This would make the analysis more heuristic and decrease the dependence of the results on assumptions made by the researcher.

In retrospect there should have been more pretreatment? of the measured data before analysis was done. Inaccuracies arrose due to the first 90 sec of the measurements being taken before the furnace was turned on and the thermocouples still measuring after the fire died down.
These measurement discrepancies between model and measurement should have been better taken into account and excluded form modelling. 

This research can be expanded and applied to the measured data available for Eucalyptus. 
Applying the same algorithm to different data sets and obtaining accurate modelling from both data sets would be confirmation that the algorithm is accurate enough to be further explored for usage in practice.
