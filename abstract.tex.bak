%  What the objectives of the study were (the central question);
  In this report, stochastic inversion methods such as Markov Chain Monte-Carlo and optimisation methods were used to determine the thermal diffusivity of SA-Pine.
%Brief statement of what was done (Methods);
A finite element model was constructed to model a $100$mm element exposed to the ISO 846 Fire curve.
This model was used within the likelihood function of TODO
%Brief statement of what was found (Results);
New $\kappa$-values were found from MCMC and MAP analysis.
The MCMC and MAP $\kappa$-values were not equal, supporting the hypothesis that the distribution is not normal.
The FEM model using the new $\kappa$-values was closer to the measured temperatures.

%Brief statement of what was concluded (Discussion);
