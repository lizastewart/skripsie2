\section*{GA1: Problem Solving}
In Chapter \ref{introduction} the problem as well as the relevant aims and objectives are explained. The problem is approached systematically and a solution is proposed in Chapter \ref{implementation}.
\section*{GA2: Application of scientific and engineering knowledge}
The problem tackled in this project was mathematically and statistically complex. 
The report was laid out in a way that would make sense to the reader even if they had minimal understanding of the MCMC algorithm. 
The limitations of this project were presented in Chapter \ref{discussion}.(TODO)
\section*{GA4: Investigations,experiments and data analysis}
An overview of the available knowledge and previous studies on the matter is presented in Section \ref{litstudy}. 
Multiple versions of the final algorithm were considered, corrected and fine-tuned. The results are analysed and discussed in Chapter \ref{results} and \ref{discussion}. A final conclusion was draw and presented in Chapter \ref{conclusion}.
\section*{GA5: Engineering methods , skill and tools, including IT}
The following subjects were directly relevant and needed for the completion of this project:\
\begin{itemize}
\item Informatics 244, 314;
\item Applied Mathematics 252;
\item Engineering Statistics 314;
\item Engineering Mathematics 115, 145, 214;
\end{itemize}
