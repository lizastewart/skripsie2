\chapter{Acknowledgements}
 
I would like to thank Prof. de Koker for all his support and encouragement, and for believing in me even when I didn't necessarily believe in myself.
My loved ones and parents cannot be forgotten for keeping me sane and providing countless mugs of coffee.
I want to thank my friends and classmates for listening to me and sharing in the frustrations along the way.
A special mention of Danie Els for creating this lovely Latex template and all the strangers on StackExchange for helping me master the template.
