\chapter{Finite Element Modelling}
\section{Existing Model}
	For this project an existing finite element model of heat diffusion by Prof. N de Koker will be modified for usage in the Bayes' theorem~\ref{bayes_eq}. 
	This model will be used to determine the likelihood function. 
	The current model uses the standard Euro code k-values as well as the specific heat specified in the \citep{Euro:2004}. 
	
	The model discretises the wooden element into 32 different elements. For finite element analysis there are always more elements used to generate the model than usually evaluated. This is done to improve the accuracy of said model.
	The model is a one dimensional finite element model that takes time differentiation into account. 
	
	
\section{Adapted Model}	
	The model was changed into a function that takes k-values and provides a new temperature distribution over the elements for the different k-values. 
	This function is used in the posterior calculation to determine the likelihood function.
